// Js is scripting language
//A scripting language is a programming language that is designed for scripting tasks,
//which are typically simple and repetitive operations.
//These tasks can include automating routine tasks, processing data, or controlling
//the behavior of software applications.

// Scripting languages are often interpreted rather than compiled, which means that the code is
//executed directly by an interpreter without the need for compilation into machine code.
//This makes scripting languages more flexible and easier to use than traditional programming languages.

// Some popular examples of scripting languages include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, and Bash.
//These languages are often used for tasks such as web development, automation,
//system administration, and data processing.

//Eg. JavaScript Translated line by line
//code -> JS Engine -> Machine Language

//Eg. Java It's has it's own compiler so translated into byte code before run time
// Code -> Compiler ->Byte Code -> JVM -> Machine Language

//The bytecode is essentially an intermediate representation of the code
//that is optimized for efficient execution by the JVM.

// Property of JavaScript
// 1. Synchronous
// 2. Blocking
// 3. Single Threaded

// Almost Everything in JavaScript is Object Except Primitive Data Type

// JavaScript Never Sleep()s ???
